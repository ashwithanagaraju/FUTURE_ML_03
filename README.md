# Customer Support Chatbot (LLM-based)

This project implements a customer support chatbot powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) to provide real-time, conversational assistance for common customer queries such as order status inquiries, billing-related issues, and general service questions. The chatbot leverages modern natural language processing techniques to understand user intent and generate context-aware, human-like responses through a lightweight web-based interface.

The system demonstrates the practical application of large language models in customer-facing environments, showcasing how conversational AI can be integrated into web applications to support automated assistance workflows. The solution focuses on applied AI system design rather than rule-based automation and reflects current industry practices in deploying scalable conversational AI systems.
