# Customer Support Chatbot 

This project implements a customer support chatbot designed to provide real-time, conversational assistance for common customer queries such as order status checks, billing-related issues, and general service inquiries. The system leverages a large language model (LLM) to interpret user intent and generate context-aware responses without relying on rigid, rule-based logic.

The chatbot is integrated into a lightweight web interface to demonstrate how modern conversational AI systems can be deployed as customer-facing support tools. The project emphasizes applied AI system design, showcasing the use of large language models to automate support workflows while maintaining response quality, scalability, and usability in practical scenarios.
